# Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview Analysis
In this project, bikesharing data was pulled from [Citi Bike System Database](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) as a csv file, and converted to visual representation in Tableau. 

The raw data csv file was then used to create a new csv, bikeShare.csv, in Jupyter Notebook to convert trip duration integeter to datetime. This was used to display charts displaying hour and minutes for trip durations. 

### Purpose
This purpose of this project was to visualize data from citibike in New York, to analyze whether it would be successful in Des Moines. 

### Resources
**Data Source:** [Citi Bike Raw Data](/201908-citibike-tripdata.csv), [Citi Bike Converted Data](/bikeShare.csv)

**Tools:** Tableau, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

## Summary
In summary, the bikesharing data reveals that the average rider is: 
 - Male
 - Commuting most-likey to work, with popularity of usage peaking at 8:00am and between 5:00pm and 6:00pm. 
 - Riding for 0 - 20 minutes with each use. 
 - an Annual subscriber

 The story maps showing start and end journies by popularity, relay a sense of consumer-designed responsibility with correlating start and end journey popularities. This data collectively implies high-levels of community involvement and reliability on bike-sharing. 

Two additional visualizations that might be useful to confirm this interpretation would be: 
 1. Comparing the rider start and stop times with the longitude and latitude to display peak areas of traffic at given times.
 2. Compaing the riders birth year with peak times to correlate biking reliance on age groups.
